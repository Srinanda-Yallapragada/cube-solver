# Cube-Solver

Credits:
cube_solver.py was NOT written by either of us. It was from Simon Massey. Github repository found here: 
https://github.com/simbo1905/CubieMoves
It requires additional files to be able to run, but they aren't included here for brevity sake.
A few tweaks have been made such that it would be usable in our project.
